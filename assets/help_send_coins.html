			You have initiated the process of sending coins.
			You came here either through the main screen or by clicking on a Bitcoin URL in your mobile browser.

			First, you enter the Bitcoin address to pay to.
			The address will autocomplete from known entries in your address book.
			You can also scan QR codes with Bitcoin addresses or Bitcoin requests by pressing the QR button in the action bar (ZXing Scanner or Goggles needed).
		</p>
		<p>
			Next, you can see how many Bitcoins you can spend at the moment.
			Any difference to the balance from the main screen is still unconfirmed and can thus not yet be spent.
		</p>
		<p>
			Last, you enter the amount to pay and the fee you are offering.
			Currently, a minimum fee of BTC 0.0005 is recommended in order to get your transaction processed.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can enter a transaction while being offline.
			It will be sent on next restart of Bitcoin Wallet.
			If you want a transaction to be processed as fast as possible, make sure you are well connected (i.e. on a WLAN) and have good Bitcoin connectivity (see Bitcoin connectivity indicator in left notification area).
		</p>
		<p>
			Note:
			Transactions cannot be undone!
			Always check the receiving address.
